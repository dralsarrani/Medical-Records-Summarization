# 🏥 AI Medical Records Summarization

An AI-powered system that automatically summarizes patient medical records to help healthcare practitioners quickly understand key clinical information.
This project uses NLP techniques to extract key findings, diagnoses, medications, and other essential medical details.



## 📌 Overview

Medical records often contain long, unstructured information written by multiple healthcare providers.
This project aims to build an intelligent **Medical Records Summarization System** that transforms lengthy medical texts into clear, concise, and accurate summaries.

The goal is to support:

* Faster clinical decision-making
* Reduced cognitive load on healthcare workers
* Improved patient data accessibility
* Better workflow efficiency in healthcare systems



## 🧠 Project Objectives

* Automatically summarize long medical texts using NLP
* Extract critical clinical information (diagnosis, symptoms, medications)
* Maintain high medical accuracy and context understanding
* Reduce human review time while improving data clarity
* Preserve patient privacy throughout the process



## ⚙️ System Architecture

The system consists of:

### **1. Healthcare Practitioner**

* Submits the medical record
* Receives summarized output

### **2. AI Summarization Engine**

* NLP-based pipeline
* Text preprocessing
* Entity extraction
* Summary generation

### **3. System Administrator**

* Manages data storage
* Oversees access control
* Maintains system updates



## 🗂️ Features
